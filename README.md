this is intended just to take a few notes for personal use. Nothing interesting here then. 

l. I would call 'Static Mapping App' a  sw that draws a map by just reading data from cfg file.
2. For 'Dynamic Mapping/Monitoring App' I mean a sw which can collect real-time data from the network, and then show contextualized alerts    to help ICT team to troubleshooting the infrastructure.
